to start server u can 
npm start [global]
npx expo start [local]
expo start [global]
[global] is recommended

expo cant no loner build an app 
they use eas instead and u have ofc to install it

to build ur app 
u use this `eas build production --platform android`
or this `eas build --profile production --platform android`

first one asks u while building while secound one takes information directly form eas.json

eas.json has the data of ur app and it is by defualt making ur app wih extension .aab
but i modified the eas.json to make make .apk and i succeeded in both

furehter thing before finishing ur app it asks u for if u want it for emulator or not and i recommend to u `n` but i dont know what is the difference
of the two apps
